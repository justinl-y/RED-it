The purpose of this project was to make a React, component based web application using Redux to manage data state within the program.

This project was designed to mimic a reddit post application.

## Technologies Used
- React
- Redux
- Javascript
- Webpack
- ESLint
- Babel

## Personal Learnings
The development of this project allowed me to explore React and Redux as a development 
framework for building component-based single page applications.

I also learned how to initiate and setup a project development environment 
using tools such as javaScript linters and babel transpilers.
